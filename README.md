Microwave Similator, Tools &amp; Libraries
## Introduction
scholar-mw project is  set of computation and simulation software written in Java and Scala focused on microwave and antenna theory yet it proposes  general purpose computation tools. Mainly this project is composed of hadrumaths, a linear algebra library focused on ease of use, hadruwaves a microwave modeling framework implementing Transverse Resonance Method (Method Of Moment).
## Hadrumaths (formerly Maths)
  Computation Libray in Java and Scala focused on
   + Accessibility
   + Performance
   + Repeatability (Cache support)
   + Distribution
 The Library provides functions
   + Complex Algebra
   + Matrix Algebra (large, sparse, peristent, matrices)
   + Symbolic algebra (Expressions)
   + Symbolic algebra (Expressions)
   + Interoperablity/Support for jblas,matlab,ojalgo,jama,derive,...
  
## Hadruwaves (formerly TMWlib)
  Microwave Modeling Framework
